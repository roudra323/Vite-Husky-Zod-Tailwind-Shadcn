# Vite-Husky-Zod-Tailwind-Shadcn Template

This project is a robust and efficient template for building React applications. It leverages the power of several popular libraries and tools to provide a seamless development experience.

## Features

- **Vite:** Enjoy a faster and leaner development experience for your React app with Vite. It provides a faster and more efficient build process compared to traditional tools like Webpack.
- **Husky:** Keep your project bug-free with Husky's pre-commit hooks. It ensures that all commits meet the project's linting standards.
- **Zod:** Validate data with ease using Zod. It's a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Style your app with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **Shadcn:** This project also uses Shadcn, a utility for generating box-shadow CSS with smooth transitions between light and dark modes.
